# Scenarios

## 1. Inspect an existing KMP project and report whether Multipaz is already configured correctly

- Input task: Inspect this Kotlin Multiplatform wallet project and tell me whether Multipaz is configured correctly.
- Expected skill behavior: run the inspection script, classify modules and targets, summarize dependency style, and identify missing or suspicious setup.
- Required inspection steps: inspect Gradle wrapper, versions, targets, source sets, Multipaz dependencies, manifests, plists, and entitlements.
- Mistakes to avoid: skipping inspection, guessing versions, or assuming Android and iOS feature parity.
- Evidence of success: a report grounded in actual files and dependencies.
- Validation expectations: run both inspection scripts.

- Evidence of success: minimal, version-aligned dependency changes.
- Validation expectations: dependency checker reports no new inconsistencies.

## 3. Create and securely store a locally generated credential

- Input task: Create a local test credential and store it safely.
- Expected skill behavior: use `DocumentStore`, `SecureArea`, and sample-backed document type setup.
- Required inspection steps: locate secure-area and document-store patterns in the target project or samples.

## 7. Respond correctly when asked to add Multipaz NFC credential presentation to iOS

- Input task: Add Multipaz NFC presentment to iOS.
- Expected skill behavior: refuse to generate iOS NFC presentment code, explain the limitation, and recommend a verified alternative.
- Required inspection steps: verify current repository state and inspect iOS-supported alternatives.
- Mistakes to avoid: adding `CoreNFC`, entitlements, or copied Android logic.
- Evidence of success: no iOS NFC code is generated.
- Validation expectations: the response explicitly states that Multipaz NFC credential presentation is currently not supported on iOS.

## 8. Respond correctly when asked to create one shared NFC implementation for Android and iOS

- Input task: Make one shared NFC implementation for both platforms.
- Expected skill behavior: explain that shared protocol logic may exist, but Multipaz NFC transport and engagement code cannot be shared across Android and iOS as a supported feature today.
- Required inspection steps: verify Android sample support and iOS lack of supported NFC presentment.
- Mistakes to avoid: moving NFC transport code into `commonMain`.

- Validation expectations: the answer rejects unsupported shared iOS NFC implementation.

## 9. Add BLE proximity presentation where supported by the current version

- Input task: Add BLE proximity presentment.
- Expected skill behavior: verify BLE support in the selected version and use sample-backed connection method or transport settings.

## 11. Create a verifier request using DCQL

- Input task: Create a DCQL verifier request.
- Expected skill behavior: build from sample-backed request formats and current document types.
- Required inspection steps: inspect DCQL examples and requested credential format.

- Evidence of success: request structure matches sample-backed current behavior.
- Validation expectations: request is grounded in current examples.

## 12. Diagnose an Android NFC declaration or lifecycle problem

- Input task: Diagnose why Android NFC presentment is not starting.
- Expected skill behavior: inspect manifest declarations, service registration, and lifecycle hooks.
- Required inspection steps: check `android.permission.NFC`, `android.hardware.nfc`, `BIND_NFC_SERVICE`, and NFC adapter setup.
- Mistakes to avoid: generic Android NFC advice unrelated to Multipaz.
- Evidence of success: diagnosis cites the concrete missing or incorrect file entries.
- Validation expectations: Android compile and manifest review.

## 13. Diagnose an iOS entitlement or framework problem for a supported iOS feature

- Input task: Fix an iOS Identity Document or QR presentment integration issue.
- Expected skill behavior: focus on supported iOS features such as QR or Identity Document integration.

- Validation expectations: compile and, when available, relevant tests.

## 16. Upgrade an older project to the current Multipaz version without upgrading unrelated dependencies

- Input task: Upgrade this wallet to the current Multipaz release only.
- Expected skill behavior: inspect current dependency state, update only Multipaz dependencies, explain breakage, and validate affected targets.
- Required inspection steps: version inspection, dependency scan, sample comparison, and platform impact review.
- Mistakes to avoid: upgrading Kotlin, AGP, Compose, or unrelated libraries without cause.
- Evidence of success: only relevant dependencies change.
- Validation expectations: dependency check and targeted builds pass.

## 17. Identify insecure sample configuration and propose production-safe changes

- Input task: Review this sample integration for production risks.
- Expected skill behavior: flag embedded keys, plaintext storage, disabled trust, or verbose sensitive logging.

## 18. Explain which code belongs in `commonMain`, `androidMain`, and iOS source sets

- Input task: Help me split this Multipaz code across source sets.
- Expected skill behavior: place document and protocol logic in shared code when supported, and platform wiring in platform source sets.
- Required inspection steps: inspect API usage and platform imports.
- Mistakes to avoid: broad claims that everything in a holder flow is shared.
- Evidence of success: source-set split maps to current APIs.
- Validation expectations: compile affected targets.

## 19. Detect Android-only NFC code that was incorrectly placed in `commonMain`

- Input task: Find Android-only NFC code in shared code.
- Expected skill behavior: run the dependency checker and flag Android-only markers in shared or iOS source sets.
- Required inspection steps: scan `commonMain` and iOS sources for Android-specific imports and presentment classes.
- Mistakes to avoid: missing `PresentmentActivity`, Android manifest assumptions, or APDU services.
- Evidence of success: flagged files and markers are concrete.
- Validation expectations: checker output contains the evidence.

## 20. Recommend supported iOS alternatives when a developer asks for NFC presentation

- Input task: I need iOS NFC, what should I do instead?
- Expected skill behavior: explain the unsupported status and recommend only version-verified alternatives such as QR, BLE-backed flows, browser, or Identity Document integration.
- Required inspection steps: inspect current repo support and selected app architecture.
- Mistakes to avoid: recommending every alternative without checking availability.
- Evidence of success: the alternative path is explicitly verified against the current version.
- Validation expectations: response preserves the Android-only NFC boundary.

## Required NFC Evaluation Behavior

Scenario: Add Multipaz NFC credential presentation to both Android and iOS.

- Expected behavior:
1. Inspect the Multipaz version and repository.
2. Explain that NFC presentation is currently supported only on Android.
3. Implement or propose the Android NFC portion using verified APIs and samples.
4. Do not generate iOS NFC implementation code.
5. Recommend a verified alternative for iOS.
6. Keep shared credential and protocol logic in common code only where appropriate.
7. Keep NFC transport or engagement logic in `androidMain`.
8. Clearly report the resulting platform capability difference.
- Failure conditions:
- claims iOS NFC support exists
- generates iOS NFC presentation code
- adds iOS NFC entitlements for the unsupported flow
- copies Android NFC code into `commonMain`
- implies Android and iOS have equivalent NFC support
